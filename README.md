I haven't found a productivity application that works for me,
so I figured, why not develop my own?

Here is my application that is free to download and use, developed to be compatible with online web usage as well as application support.

The idea behind this is to provide a website experience that makes it easier to set up your goals,
and an application experience that makes it easier to check them off throughout the day.
